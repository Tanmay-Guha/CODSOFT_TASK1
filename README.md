# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

A classic machine learning project to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using historical data.

## 🧠 Objective
Build a classification model using features like age, gender, passenger class, and fare to predict survival.

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

## 📊 Key Steps
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning (missing values, outliers)
- Feature engineering (e.g., title extraction, family size)
- Model training & evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)

## 📌 Insights
- Women and children had higher survival rates.
- First-class passengers had a higher chance of survival.
- Handling missing age values with class-wise median imputation improved accuracy.

## 🧪 Results
- Model Accuracy: ~XX%
- Precision / Recall: XX% / XX%
